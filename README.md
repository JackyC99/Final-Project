Final-Project is a simple simulation game where your main objective is to grow a tree.

In the game, there is a water counter and a growth counter and it will only annonuced your progress with the growth and how much water your tree have.(Both are percentage)
There is also an option to go to work to earn coins to water the plant.(I did plan to add an affinity system between you and your co worker butt I never got to it.)(Also, while you work, your tree has a chance of losing water,that isn't display anywhere in the text(I did that on purpose))
There is also a store where you can spend your coin on. However currently there do nothing, its just a way to spend your coins. I did plan for the store to sell usful stuff that benefits with growing the tree.
